    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "What depth of exploration can your helicopter EM surveys achieve?",
      answer: "Our helicopter EM surveys can detect conductive bodies at depths ranging from near-surface to over 300 meters depending on the geological conditions, survey parameters, and the conductivity contrast between the target and surrounding rocks."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "How long does a typical HeliCheck survey take to complete?",
      answer: "Survey duration depends on the size of the area, line spacing, and weather conditions. Typically, we can cover 100-150 line kilometers per day. We provide detailed timeline estimates during the quotation process based on your specific project requirements."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-5",
      question: "What data deliverables can I expect from a HeliCheck survey?",
      answer: "Our standard deliverables include processed data in industry-standard formats (GDB, ASCII, GeoTIFF), maps and images of all measured and derived parameters, interpretation reports, and full documentation of the survey parameters and processing steps."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-6",
      question: "How does HeliCheck ensure data quality?",
      answer: "Our staff are dedicated to producing the highest quality data. We employ rigorous quality control protocols during data acquisition, in-field quality control, processing, and final reporting. All data undergoes multiple validation steps before delivery to clients."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-7",
      question: "What makes HeliCheck different from other geophysical survey providers?",
      answer: "HeliCheck is managed by a committed group of geophysicists and engineers with over 30 years of experience in developing advanced survey instrumentation and techniques. Our proprietary technologies enable greater depth of exploration and higher resolution surveys, providing better quality and less ambiguous data that are obtained more efficiently than with conventional methods."
